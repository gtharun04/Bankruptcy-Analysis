# Bankruptcy-Analysis
Predicting which companies will go under bankruptcy.
The dataset used in this analysis has been downloaded from UCI repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction .
We have named it as Original_data. 
All the EDA is completed in Jupyter notebook while the modelling is built on MATLAB. Due to the properties of the data, I have used SMOTE technique to balance the data.
I preferred K-Nearest Neighbours and Naive Baise to test on this dataset. KNN was able to perform well on this data while the NB hasn't showed good results.
