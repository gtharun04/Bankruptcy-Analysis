# Bankruptcy Analysis
Predicting which companies will go under bankruptcy


## Data

The dataset used in this analysis has been downloaded from UCI repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction
## Approach

Two models were built for this analysis in MATLAB.
I preferred K-Nearest Neighbours and Naive Baise to test on this dataset. KNN was able to perform well on this data while the NB hasn't showed good results.
Initial EDA is completed in Jupyter Notebook. Due to the properties of the data, I have used SMOTE technique to balance the data.
